# Educational App - Radio Waves Game

## Overview
The **Radio Waves Game** is an educational and interactive application designed to teach players about the basics of radio wave propagation through engaging game mechanics. Developed as a final project for **CS3505 - Software Practice**, this game helps players understand radio frequencies and antenna operations through interactive gameplay.

## Features
- **Educational Content**: 
  - Each level introduces fundamental concepts about radio operations, including wave frequencies, antenna types, and signal propagation.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: 
  - Players control a virtual environment where they can manipulate objects and variables to observe real-time changes in radio wave behaviors.
- **Level Progression**: 
  - The game features a variety of levels, each with specific objectives and challenges that reinforce the educational content.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**:
  - Interactive elements such as rocks, trees, hills, and humans can affect wave propagation, requiring players to adjust their strategies.
- **Particle Mesh Visualization**:
  - A mesh of particles represents the medium through which waves propagate, providing visual feedback on the effects of player adjustments.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in the appropriate development environment (e.g., Qt Creator, Visual Studio, or Unity if applicable).
3. Compile and run the project.

## How to Play
1. Select a level and read the educational prompt.
2. Adjust the environment by placing obstacles or modifying frequency settings.
3. Observe how changes affect wave propagation.
4. Complete the level objectives to progress further.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement additional levels with more complex radio wave interactions.
- Add a scoring system to evaluate player performance.
- Improve UI/UX with more intuitive controls and better visualization.
- Develop a tutorial mode for first-time players.
